# Module 7 - Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Pewlett Hackard Analysis
--Explain the purpose of this analysis


#### The Pewlett Hackard Module was to teach the basics of Postgres SQL. We began with creating a ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) from Quick DBD to act as a map. Once we understood the relationships of all the data we could start creating tables, refering to the ERD to see which tables had which data we wanted and why kind of data it was. As we created the tables we learned the basics of SQL language, like SELECT, FROM and WHERE. Once we began joining data from different tables we also learn INTO, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DISTINCE ON and the different types of JOINS. Once we had the understanding of those functions we could dive into the challenege.

#### The Pewlett Hackard Analysis taugh us how to implement the differnt functions we learned in the module without giving us the code to reference. The goal of the analysis was to: #### a) Determine the number of retiring employees per title
#### b) Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
#### In this challenege we used all of the functions mentioned above with the addition of DISTINCT ON in order to only display the most recent title for employees that were coming up on retirement.
